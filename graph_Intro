graph is data sturucture which store data in the form vertex and edges.
it 2 types are directed and undirected graph directed graph point to some vertex in one way using edges while undirected point to vertex in both way 
it has 2 properties regarding the directed graph indegree which is no of edges pointed to this vertex 
2.one is outdegree no of edges going out from this vertex

in undirected graph for a vertex and there is not fixed type of definition like indegree out here just degree is used to tell a vertex has degree of what no how much in 
terms of indegree or outdegree.

maximum no of edges in directed graph in not self connected graph  |v| * (|v|-1)
and in undirected graph |v| * (|v|-1)/2 whole upon 2 this is not only v-1


more term in graph
walk a walk is just a step going to one vertex to another is called walk which is connected to 2nd vertex 
path is special type of walk where no repetition is allowed
some book used walk as path and path as simple path remember this

cyclic graph is graph when u begin to 1 vertex and reach the same vertex so this is called

acyclic graph which not contain a cycle
dag (directed ascyclic graph) used a lot is graph so remember this also

weighted graph is graph where weight is assigned to edges.
it could be directed and undirected
