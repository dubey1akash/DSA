so basically they stored in continous location not like the way they represent so address is continous
and they r store in row major and column manjor order which mean u keep 1 row then next 2 row then 3 row or 1 column first 2 column then 3rd column so on
that is way but in continous only this is pattern
c++ follow row order storation 
curly bracket is optional which mean only one u can use and put all the element it will work accordingly of ur decloration of a[m][n]
but it is not recommended although
and u can omit the first declartion of size in matrix that is optional it figure out auto for big size also 3 3 4 by 4 but only first one u can omit
vector created matrix are not cache friend as it does not store continously as normal c++ does it store at diff loc
vector arr[i] size of column and  arr give size of row
here need to use double pointer to pass it the another function so that it work
but vector can be used for making this thing easy only cache is problem
