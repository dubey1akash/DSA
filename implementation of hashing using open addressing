so hashing can be implement in 2 ways one way is chaining and another is open addressing 
basically these 2 are used to handle collison handling only but we have to see which one is better
hashing is just function whose work is to handle collison but at the end we are using this function to create a hash table
here we use only not linked list and we consider to take size of an array equal to or > gr than total keys
advantage is cache friendly as address referece we have
this (open addressing hashing) implemented many way like linear probing and quadratic and double hashing 
linear probing is linearly search for an empty space in array which key u have find collided with ur hashing function key%7 this is hash fun
here i see in linear probing there is problem of clustering which is basically ur deleting element or inserting element to next empty index as linear probing do but it is
also creating issue of clustering here.so making these operationg costly again search insert and delete
solve these issue with quadratic and double hashing
load factor should be 1 i think which same no of table as no of key this is criteria for open addressing
