how to check if nubmer is power of 2 or not??

*******************************************************************************/
if((n&(n-1))==0){
    cout<<"this number is power of 2";
}
as this is property of binary number
if n is power of 2 like 4 =2^2 then doing n-1 which is 4 
and doing end it should result as 0
but this is not true for any other nuber like 5 and 4 as 
5 is not power of 2
