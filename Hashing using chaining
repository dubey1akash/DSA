hash table is implemented by address table method which is basically index of array to fill key and value so that access become fast
load factor is  n/m where m no of slot is hash table and n is no of keys to be inserted
it tell what percentage going to be collide so if n = m then u can say no collison right as it will distribute key uniformly right
so that u can understand load factor concept like when it should be good or bad depending upon n and m
here remember m is taken prime so that less collison happened as dividing give less remainder things of all the digit last
also u can't take m as 2^m and 10 ^m where m can be anything but after taking these 2 it always point to last digit only so better not take this as m
u can do math to understand this is true
